Compared to the 19th-century institutions where leaders sent diplomats to “lie for his country,” today’s consulates and embassies are filled by officers who spend more time assisting overseas citizens, interviewing visa applicants, and collecting local intellegence. A character in a 1960 novel expresses such a view: The Foreign Service has had its day - enjoyable while it lasted, no doubt, but over now. The privileged being of the future is the travel agent.

Through institutionalizing an official relationship, a country recognize that its partner is ideologically agreeable, and that further exchange of commerce, people, and ideas will be beneficial to both the governments and the population. If a measurement of diplomatic appeal can be built on diplomatic representation data, we can answer a number of interesting questions in world politics: How is a ranking of authority different from one of military power or economic size?
