<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>In today’s world, modern diplomatic exchange simply reflects the mundane interactions of an interdependent world. Compared to the Nineteenth Century when leaders sent diplomats abroad to “lie for his country,” today’s consulates and embassies are run by officers who spend more time assisting overseas citizens, interviewing visa applicants, and collecting local intelligence.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Similarly, diplomacy has fallen by the wayside as an important academic subject in political science. While we spend a lot of time talking about “soft power,” or the ability to convince and attract allies and adversaries without resorting to force or threats, we rarely tie this discussion to the diplomatic efforts policy makers actually use to foster it.</p>
<p>Diplomatic representation, however, is much more important than commonly perceived. When Obama decided to end the U.S.-Cuba antagonism, one key gesture was the reopening of the Embassy in Havana. Following independence, India sent a special delegation to Europe that recommended establishing representation in Nordic states – which had neither commercial nor colonial ties with India – to learn their diplomacy (Pant 2008). In both cases, diplomatic representation was a reflection of the appeal of an international partner. Diplomacy institutionalizes this appeal based on the belief that further exchange of commerce, people, and ideas will be beneficial to both the governments and the population.</p>
<p>Since one cannot directly observe this diplomatic appeal or “soft power,” but only its implications on actual diplomatic activities, it is a latent variable the same way psychologists think about latent traits such as self-monitoring and intellectual capability. Due to this similarity, psychometrics has much to offer researchers in international politics who seek to unpack this difficult question. This is an important new direction that has the potential to reinvigorate a long-dormant area of political science.</p>
<p>In political science, “diplomatic exchange” refers to the activity that a “receiving state” receives diplomatic mission from a “sending state.” As suggested in the previous example of U.S.-Cuban rapprochement, the opening of one state’s Embassy in a foreign state implies a positive development of their bilateral relationship. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1966) also states that in addition to “developing their economic, cultural and scientific relations,” the function of diplomatic missions is to “friendly relations between the sending State and the receiving State. While some scholars analyzed the exchange of three ordinal classes – ambassador, minister, and chargé d’affaires (Singer &amp; Small 1966), recent work focuses mostly on the binary versions: whether a diplomatic exchange exist between two countries at all (see Neumayer 2008, Kinne 2014) or whether two countries exchange their ambassadors (Kinne 2014).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite earlier attempts in measuring a variety of concepts from the mentioned diplomatic exchange data, several methodological issues remain. One is the implicit assumption that diplomatic representations from all countries have the same weight – a country’s diplomatic appeal is the sum of the diplomatic exchange it receives – or have a set of weights that can be calculated through second-level factors such as the total diplomatic exchange each of the sending country. While the problem with the first claim is that an ambassador from a small country might have a different bearing on the receiving state compared to an ambassador from a powerful one, the logic of the second claim is also problematic. Even if two countries receive an identical number of exchange as receivers, it does not follow that both will also behave the same way as senders. Hungary and Venezuela both received 83 diplomatic exchange in 2005. However, the two countries have foreign policy preferences in forming diplomatic ties so different that it would be more appropriate to estimate their weights in other ways. I argue that because an IRT model takes how willing/able are a state to establish a diplomatic exchange (item difficulty) and to what extent its decision is related to the diplomatic appeal of the receiving state (item discrimination), it is possible to sidestep overly strong assumptions while still achieving reasonable performance.</p>
<p>The second issue of the literature is the limited investigation between a measurement scale and state behaviors in actual contexts. Existing measurement projects using the diplomatic exchange data tend to focus on ranking and ordering states along a latent scale but not how easy or difficult for a particular state can achieve that rank. On the other hand, research that explains the binary outcome of diplomatic exchange through a list of covariates using logistic regressions tells us the average probability two countries have diplomatic exchange given a set of parameter values (see Neumayer 2008). However, it is unable to answer questions such as “given the receiving state A’s diplomatic appeal and sending state B’s preference in establishing diplomatic exchange, what is the probability that B will send a diplomatic mission to A?” Answering questions as such require a more meaningful scale that speaks to the characteristics of both the receiver and the sender. As will be shown, IRT is highly suitable for this purpose.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
